3. After downloading the ZIP archive now you'll need to make a new folder called `teleports` in the same folder as `CLibrary.dll`.
4. Extract the ZIP files that we downloaded.
5. Try browsing the folders and find the spesific thing you want (e.g Chests, oculi)

# Using it on akebi
After finding the thing you wanted (in this tutorial i'll be using apples as example):
1. Move the json files to the `teleports` folder that you just created.
2. Open `Custom Teleport` tab on akebi.

4. Tick the `Auto Teleport` option on and set Delay to the value you wanted. Higher = better (FInd the best value for yourself. I recommend using 25>).
5. Tick the `All` on Teleports and press the `Select` button.
